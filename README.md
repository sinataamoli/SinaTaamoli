Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a **PhD candidate in Physics at the University of California, Riverside**, where my research focuses on **Large-Scale Structures** and their impact on **Galaxy Evolution**.

Here on GitHub, I share **code** and **notebooks** related to my research, along with **teaching materials** from courses Iâ€™ve taught in **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, **Data Visualization**, and **Computer Graphics** at **UC Riverside**.

Feel free to explore, fork, or connect!
