Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a **PhD candidate in Physics** at University of California, Riverside. My research is focused on Large Scale Structures and their impact on Galaxy Evolution. 

Here on GitHub, I share **code**, **notebooks**, and **projects** related to my research. I also post **teaching materials** from my courses in **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, **Data Visualization**, and **Computer Graphics** taught at **UC Riverside**.  

Feel free to explore, fork, or connect!
